Show-Off Overview
=================

In this section we'd like to show you a couple of hopefully illustrative examples that demonstrate how *swave* can be
used to model real-world algorithms. If this is your first contact point with the *swave* documentation it could be
that not all constructs immediately make sense to you. However, you should still be able to get a feel for what
programming with *swave* looks like.

These are the examples that are currently available:

* @ref[fibonacci](fibonacci.md)


Contributions Welcome
---------------------

Since the range of possible applications for streaming with *swave* is so broad we are always looking for interesting
examples to show here. So, if you think you have a nice and self-contained example that other users could benefit from
we very much invite you to @ref[submit a PR] and include it here (ideally using ticket number @github[#21](#21)).
