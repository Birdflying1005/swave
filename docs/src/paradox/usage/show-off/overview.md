Show-Off Overview
=================

In this section we'd like to show you a couple of hopefully illustrative examples that demonstrate how *swave* can be
used to model real-world algorithms. If this is your first contact point with the *swave* documentation it could be
that not all the code and the accompanying comments immediately make sense to you. However, in this case you should
still be able to get a feel for what programming with *swave* looks like and maybe come back later, after having
looked through subsequent chapters. 

These are the examples that are currently available:

* @ref[MD5](md5.md)
* @ref[Fibonacci](fibonacci.md)


Contributions Welcome!
----------------------

Since the range of possible applications for streaming with *swave* is so broad we are always looking for interesting
examples to show here. So, if you think you have a nice and self-contained example that other users could benefit from
we very much invite you to @ref[submit a PR][] (ideally referencing ticket number @github[#21](#21)) to include your
example here.
