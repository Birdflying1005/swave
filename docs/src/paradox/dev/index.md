Developer Documentation
=======================

... TODO ...

In this section we plan on providing concrete guidance for finding one's way around the *swave* internals,
targeted at everyone who'd like to contribute actual code to the project for the first time.
For example these things be discussed:

- the introduction of the 7 types of "signals" that drive every processing stage in a stream setup
- the internal DSL for defining stage state machines incl. the macro expansion step 
- more in-depth discussion of the stream execution model
