Support
=======

This page lists the available options for contacting the team behind *swave* for support and everything else.

Mailing List
------------

In most cases the friendly [swave mailing list][1] is probably the best place for your needs with regard to
support, feedback and general discussion. Asking here is preferable to the [gitter channel][2], because the list archives
remain searchable for other users with similar questions even in the future.
Also, a mailing list post gives you more space to lay out your thoughts, include code snippets and follow the
discussions that are relevant to you in a by-thread manner.

Note::
:  Your first post after signup is going to be moderated (for spam protection), but we'll immediately
   give you full posting privileges if your message doesn't unmask you as a spammer.

Gitter Channel
--------------

For quick one-off questions you can also turn to the [*swave* gitter channel][2].
Keep in mind though that all discussions here are not really archived and therefore not properly searchable for others.
Also gitter doesn't support by-thread conversations and is therefore harder to follow once volume increases.

Therefore we'd like to ask you to use the mailing list for all topics that likely involve a longer discussion.

Twitter
-------

If you [follow us on twitter][1] we'll keep you informed about new developments as well as general news around *swave*.
