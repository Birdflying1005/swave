Talks on *swave*
================

The currently best talk on *swave* is [>>> swave - Reactive Streams in Scala <<<](https://youtu.be/htwmROeki0c)
from [ScalaDays 2016 @ Berlin](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-berlin-2016).

It nicely introduces the key ideas and concepts and gives a good overview over the project.
While quite a few things have evolved since this talk was given there is only one important change to be aware of:<br/>
The type called `swave.core.Stream[T]` in the talk is now called `swave.core.Spout[T]`.
